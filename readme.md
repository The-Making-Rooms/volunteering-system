# Volunteering System


This system was created to allow organisations to manage opportunities and volunteer sign ups through an easy to use platform. It is the culmination of many months of user research and has been initially launched with the Chip In project.

Chip In is a place-based volunteering project for young people from the borough of Blackburn with Darwen, with mentoring at the heart. [See the platform in action](https://chipinbwd.co.uk/) or learn more [here](https://www.communitycvs.org.uk/volunteer/chip-in/)

## ðŸ“š System Architecture:
The system is written in Django, htmx and tailwindCSS+DaisyUI. htmx is used for interactivity, and most routes have a check to see if the request has a htmx header. If it does, only a partial will be sent. DaisyUI components are used throughout using tailwind utility classes.
